print(2/4)      # This gives answer in fraction
print(4/2)      # This gives 2.0
print(4//2)     # This gives 2 beacuse it is integer division
print(2//4)     # This gives 0 beacuse it is integer division
print(11//3)    # This gives 3 beacuse it is integer division
print(6%2)      # This gives 0

#agr square root nikalna hu tou power 1/2 huti hai yani 0.5 tou exponent mn 0.5 dedo square root ajyega
#for square root of 2 we write
print(2**0.5)   #This gives square root of 2 

# there is another function for rounding the value which is round(value,digits)
print(round(2**0.5,4))
